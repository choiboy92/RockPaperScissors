# RockPaperScissors
Interactive rock, paper, scissors game on a web-front end in HTML, Javascript and some JQuery.

RockPaperScissors was created to experiment with the anime.js module for SVG animations along with creating a system of asynchrous functions in javascript. Further experimentation will be done with creating an interactive, intuitive and aesthetic front-end design.
This will hopefully also lead to data collection for machine-learning to create a smart back-end that can learn the user's patterns for this simple game.
